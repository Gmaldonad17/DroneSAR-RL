This project is a simulation of an environment with drone agents searching together for an objective. 
They learn using reinforcment learning.


The settings to configure the simulation can be found in baseline.yaml.


In order to start the simulation and training, use the following command which will implement settings automatically.
python train.py --cfg configs/baseline.yaml
